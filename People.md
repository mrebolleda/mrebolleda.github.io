## María Rebolleda Gómez (about me)
![me](NewOreleans.jpg)

I am an evolutionary ecologist fascinated with bacteria, fungi, and plants. I did my undergraduate degree in Biology at UNAM (the National University in Mexico) and my PhD at the University of Minnesota with Michael Travisano. 

I am interested in how evolutionary processes evolve, the roles of history and chance in ecology and evolution, and microbial eco-evolutionary dynamics: how ecological interactions affect evolutionary pathways and how evolution transforms ecological processes. But I am also very interested (not in order of importance) in politics, the complex interactions between science and society, geography and architecture. I like to see the world with different lenses and I have found that learning and interacting with people from other disciplines keeps me creative and engaged. In particular I am fascinated by the importance of space in shaping interactions and everyday dynamics from social housing, community spaces, urban planning to the evolution of microbial interactions. My engagements and interdisciplinary collaborations vary: workshops, outreach, community involvement, teaching and mentorship as well as different research initiatives.

I tend to be pluralist about ways of thinking and forms of looking at the world. Therefore, I really value and appreciate difference and have a strong commitment to increasing representation of minorities in science, including questioning and changing the ways our disciplines are exclusionary and built on histories of oppression.

I am a first year PhD student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UCI. I graduated from Universidad Nacional del Comahue, in Argentine Patagonia. I am interested in how eco-evolutionary factors interact at different spatio-temporal scales. More specifically, I seek to elucidate the adaptive role of epigenetics in communities of sessile organisms under climate change scenarios. Additionally, I see outreach and teaching as tools to make science a truly collective activity. In the COMMONS lab I will study how the composition of microbial communities is affected by global warming, and evaluate its potential consequences on biogeochemical cycles.
When outside the lab, I might be reading, hiking in the mountains, playing tennis or carving wood.
