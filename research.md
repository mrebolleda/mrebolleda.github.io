 Individuals and populations do not exist in a vacuum; they exist and evolve in a complex network of ecological interactions.  In the COMMONS lab we are interested in how, as organisms evolve, they transform their interactions and how these ecological changes feedback in the evolutionary dynamics and trejectories of populations and communities. 


Overall we are trying to understand (and potentially predict) the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of microbial communities. The main idea is to understand cells and their physiology as they exist in relationship with the environment and other cells. To accomplish this, we often (but not exclusively) work with [self-assebled microbial communities](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.657467/full) in relatively simple environments where we can understand their function and physiology, but without removing the context and interactions that are central to this functioning.

## Historical contingency and predictability of ecological and evolutionary dynamics
In a rapidly changing world, we would like to predict the ecological and evolutionary trajectories of populations and communities. But both ecology and evolution are historical sciences and as such, trajectories are often contingent in previous steps. This "historical contingency" is often considered a source of unpredictability because small stochastic differences in mutations or species sampling could lead to very different outcomes. However, [selection could override those small differences with time](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/evo.13654). Thus, we are interested in understanding: 

- How and when do past changes shape future ecological and evolutionary trajectories? 
- When do small stochastic differences get amplified, and when is selection able to override the effects of historical contingency? 
- To what extent and at what scales are we able to predict ecological and evolutionary trajectories of microbial communities?
